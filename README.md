# Distributed Learning

The goal of this repo is to consolidate projects and learning while reading through Designing Data Intensive Applications.
Rough guidelines for the projects have been gracefully provided by ChatGPT. The requirements will change as I focus on
areas of interest and learn more in the reading. 

## Outline

### Chapter 1: Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications
Project: Building a Simple Key-Value Store

Description:
In this project, you will design and implement a simple key-value store that focuses on reliability, scalability, and maintainability. You will explore techniques such as replication, consistency models, and fault tolerance to build a robust distributed system. The key-value store should be able to handle concurrent read and write operations efficiently while providing fault tolerance in case of node failures.

### Chapter 2: Data Models and Query Languages
Project: Developing a Document Database

Description:
In this project, you will delve into data models and query languages by designing and implementing a document database. You will explore different document schemas and their implications for data querying and indexing. The project will involve building a document storage system that supports CRUD operations and allows for flexible querying using a query language of your choice.

### Chapter 3: Storage and Retrieval
Project: Building a Log-Structured Storage System

Description:
In this project, you will focus on storage and retrieval techniques by creating a log-structured storage system. You will learn about write-ahead logs, compaction strategies, and efficient data retrieval. The project will involve designing a storage engine that efficiently handles write and read operations, manages data compaction, and provides high-performance retrieval of data.

### Chapter 4: Encoding and Evolution
Project: Implementing a Schema Evolution System - UNDETERMINED

Description:
In this project, you will explore the concepts of encoding and evolution by building a schema evolution system. You will learn about different data encoding techniques and how to handle evolving schemas gracefully. The project will involve designing a system that can handle schema changes without disrupting existing data and provide mechanisms for data migration and compatibility.

### Chapter 5: Replication
Project: Creating a Replication Framework

Description:
In this project, you will dive into replication techniques by developing a replication framework. You will explore different replication strategies, consistency models, and fault tolerance mechanisms. The project will involve designing a replication framework that can replicate data across multiple nodes, handle conflicts, ensure consistency, and provide fault tolerance in case of node failures.

### Chapter 6: Partitioning
Project: Building a Partitioned Data Store

Description:
In this project, you will focus on partitioning techniques by creating a partitioned data store. You will learn about different partitioning strategies, load balancing, and data distribution across nodes. The project will involve designing a data store that can handle data partitioning, distribute data efficiently across multiple nodes, and provide mechanisms for load balancing and fault tolerance.

### Chapter 7: Transactions
Project: Developing a Distributed Transaction System

Description:
In this project, you will explore distributed transactions by building a distributed transaction system. You will learn about transactional models, isolation levels, and distributed consensus algorithms. The project will involve designing a distributed transaction system that can coordinate transactions across multiple nodes, ensure transactional integrity, and handle concurrency and fault tolerance.

### Chapter 8: The Trouble with Distributed Systems
Project: Implementing a Distributed Monitoring System

Description:
In this project, you will focus on the challenges and troubleshooting aspects of distributed systems by developing a distributed monitoring system. You will explore techniques for monitoring and debugging distributed systems, including logging, tracing, and metrics collection. The project will involve designing a monitoring system that can collect and analyze system-level and application-level metrics, detect anomalies, and aid in troubleshooting distributed system issues.

### Chapter 9: Consistency and Consensus
Project: Developing a Distributed Consensus Algorithm

Description:
In this project, you will delve into consistency and consensus algorithms by developing a distributed consensus algorithm. You will explore different consensus protocols such as Paxos or Raft and understand their properties and trade-offs. The project will involve designing and implementing a distributed consensus algorithm that can handle failures, maintain consistency across multiple nodes, and ensure fault tolerance.

### Chapter 10: Batch Processing
Project: Creating a Distributed Batch Processing System

Description:
In this project, you will focus on batch processing techniques by building a distributed batch processing system. You will learn about data processing frameworks such as Apache Hadoop or Apache Spark and their underlying concepts. The project will involve designing and implementing a distributed batch processing system that can handle large-scale data processing, fault tolerance, and parallel execution.

### Chapter 11: Stream Processing
Project: Building a Real-Time Stream Processing System

Description:
In this project, you will explore stream processing concepts by building a real-time stream processing system. You will learn about stream processing frameworks like Apache Kafka Streams or Apache Flink and their capabilities for processing data streams in real-time. The project will involve designing and implementing a stream processing system that can handle real-time data ingestion, processing, and analytics.

### Chapter 12: The Future of Data Systems
Project: Implementing a Data System using Modern Technologies - NOT A GOOD PROJECT

Description:
~In this project, you will explore modern data system technologies and trends by implementing a data system using cutting-edge tools and frameworks. You can choose a specific technology stack that aligns with the future of data systems, such as cloud-native architectures, serverless computing, or containerization. The project will involve designing and implementing a data system that leverages modern technologies and addresses the challenges discussed in the book.~
